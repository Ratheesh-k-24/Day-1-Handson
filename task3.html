    <h1>Why to Learn Java Programming?</h1>

    <p title="Java">
      Java is a MUST for students and working professional to become a great
      software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development
      Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Java
      Programming
    </p>

    <p class="reasons">Object Oriented</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            <dd id="description01">In Java everything is an object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on object model.</dd>
        </dt>
    </dl>
    <p class="reasons">Platform Oriented</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            <dd>Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++ , when java is compiled,it is not platform specific machine,rather into platform indepent byte code.This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the virtual machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.</dd>
        </dt>
    </dl>
    <p class="reasons">Simple</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            <dd>Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of <em>OOP Java</em>, it would be easy to master.</dd>
        </dt>
    </dl>
    <p class="reasons">Secure</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            <dd>With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.</dd>
        </dt>
    </dl>
    <p class="reasons">Architecture-neutral</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            <dd>Java compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.</dd>
        </dt>
    </dl>
    <p class="reasons">Portable</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            <dd>Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable.<em>Compiler in Java is written in ANSI C</em> with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.</dd>
        </dt>
    </dl>
    <p class="reasons">Robust</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>
            <dd id="description07">Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.</dd>
        </dt>
    </dl>
